## [Automated ETL pipeline](https://github.com/camonet/movies-ETL)
This project created an automated pipeline to extract movie data from Wikipedia (JSON format) and Kaggle (csv), transform it into a consistent strucure, and then upload it into an SQL database. Creating the pipeline utilized Python, pandas libraries, SQL, PostgreSQL, and more. 
- The transformation step required the creation of various functions to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. 
- Connecting the script to an SQL database required the utilization of a database engine to automatically import the data into readable and clear tables. 

## [Manipulating Employee Information in pgAdmin](https://github.com/camonet/pewlet-hackard-analysis)
This project utilized various database managment techniques to model, engineer, and analyze data from large structured datasets containing employee information. Data modeling consisted of indentifying relationships between each of the tables to create an entity relationship diagram (ERD). In the data engineering phase a database was created, SQL queries were written to create tables, and the data was imported from CSV format. Import errors were also troubleshooted. Finally, analyis was carried out with intermediate level SQL queries utilizing multiple kinds of table joins, COUNT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY functions, as well as the creation of tailored lists of employee information. 

## [Bikeshare Mapping in Tableau](https://github.com/camonet/bikesharing)
Tableau Public was used to create a presentation for a fictional company to assess the viability of starting a bikesharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. To adequately tackle this challenge, publicly available data from CitiBike, a bikeshare service in New York City, was used. CSV files were imported into Tableau Public to create worksheets, dashboards, and stories for the final product. In this project, special consideration was placed on visualizing the data in a useful manner, which required knowing the audience, understanding their interests and concerns, and showcasing the data in a way that would satisfy their objectives and outcomes.
